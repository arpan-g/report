Building automation systems are getting extremely popular due to increasing demand to reduce energy consumption in residential and commercial  buildings. 
As there applications increases the complexity of the systems also increases making the installation and maintenance much more difficult. One of the main challenges is generating and updating the location meta-data of the sensors. Location meta-data is the primary input for many applications. Currently the location meta-data is being generated and maintained manually, this process is prone to error. An erroneous location information can make the BAS systems ineffective. Previous research have looked at clustering sensors based on there spatial locations, but not at locating the sensor in the space. In our method here we propose an automatic sensor data driven sensor location inference system. Furthermore, we validate our algorithm with two different real world testbeds. We are able to locate all the sensors accurately for one testbed and for the other testbed we observe error in the determination of sensor location for 3 out of the 43 sensors. The results appear to be promising and we provide recommendation for future work.
